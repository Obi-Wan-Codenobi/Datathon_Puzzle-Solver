# Datathon_Puzzle-Solver
For this challenge, you will be given a scrambled image.  

Your job is to write a program which can take this scrambled image, and return a string representing the ordering of the pieces that is required to unscramble this image.

Above is an example of a scrambled image, with purple numbers indicating where each puzzle piece should have been placed.

0 indicates the top left position
1 indicates the top right position
2 indicates the bottom left position
3 indicates the bottom right position
Using the above image, your program would be expected to return the string "3120".

We will provide you with a set of training images. They will be similar to the example above. All images will be 128x128 RGB pixels. All puzzles will be 2x2.

When we test your code, we will use many unique images that you do not have access to.
